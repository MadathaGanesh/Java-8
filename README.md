# Java 8 Features

This repository contains a comprehensive overview of key features introduced in Java 8. It serves as a resource for understanding and applying these features in your Java development.

## Features Covered

1. **Lambda Expressions**
   - Enables writing more concise and readable code by using anonymous functions.

2. **Functional Interfaces**
   - Introduces the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to define interfaces with a single abstract method (SAM). Functional Interface should only have a single interface only.

3. **Stream APIs**
   - Provides a powerful way to process sequences of elements, making it easier to work with collections and arrays.

4. **Default and Static Methods**
   - Allows adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations by defining default methods.

5. **Optional Class**
   - Helps in dealing with `null` values more effectively, reducing the risk of `NullPointerException`.

6. **Method References**
   - Simplifies code by referring to methods or constructors with the help of `::` operator.

7. **Collectors**
   - A utility class to accumulate elements in a collection, perform grouping, partitioning, and more.

8. **New Date and Time API**
   - Replaces the older, error-prone `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` with a more reliable and user-friendly API.

9. **Parallel Streams**
   - Enhances performance by allowing stream operations to be executed in parallel on multicore processors.

## How to Use
